The MPFIT (multipole fitting) python code obtains the partial atomic charge based on the distributed multipole analysis by Stone et al. 

## Summary 

THE MPFIT code implements Ferenczy's original partial charge fitting procedure to calculate electrostatic charges to reproduce the electrostatic potential of a distributed multipole series. This contrasts with the traditional/popular methods of potential derived charges, i.e., reproducing the molecular electrostatic potential at some atomic sites. In these latter methods, site selection, molecular orientation dependence, or charge assignment of symmetrically related centers seemingly trouble such calculations.

Potential derived charges are, of course, methods in which the charges are not obtained from the wave function, but rather, indirectly via electrostatic potentials. In lieu of computing the entire wave function, constraining some lower moments of the fitted charges to \textit{molecular multipole moments} serves as a better approach to utilizing information inherent to the wave function.
